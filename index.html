            <p>
                This is a festival to help push forth education to many people. Many children don't have a chance getting their education, having them be left behind in understanding the world around us. It is up to this festival to help fund for many low-income students to be able to attend the community colleges around the U.S.

                            While you enjoy the festives, you can explore the park to see some of nature's real beauties. View the natural world in its rawest state. Within the park, you can see many of nature's breathtaking structures, from waterfalls to the fields of flowers. If wildlife is spotted, best to inform the staff on any issue this would bring.

                        This park is also incredibly eco-friendly. Many festivals/carnivals usually use so much natural resources it seems quite detrimental to the natural world. We, however, renovated the park to push forth a more environmentally-focused design philosophy around it, so no worries if the park would cause any issues.

                        Hello, my name is Johnathan Hitchseed. I am a professor from Illinois State University. I often overlooked how education is very important, but as of lately, I've seen many students never looked into many information that you can commonly see in books. I thought to make this festival to help push education to a larger audience.
