# Project 3: Festival For A Cause: By Donovan Lee

## Overview

The basis of this project is to create a site for a fictional festival to support a cause. The chosen cause is to allow more lower-income students to have more opportunities for a higher education. A lot of higher education colleges are incredibly hard to enroll due to their enrollment prices and the acceptance rates of many classes. With this in mind, the festival is meant to provide events to provide entertainment and education through the activities. Doing so, this can help encourage people to support the cause and even bring more students to be supported by the cause.

To replicate the UI of many similar websites, the personal experiences aid in allowing for understanding the positioning and interactivity on how to replicate a similar tone to the design. This is allowed so many other users looking into the design can understand through their possible previous experiences. With the logo on the top-left of the screen, while also having the links to the other parts of the site in the top-right. The site is also responsive to the screen ratio to a phone in portrait display.

## Personal Experiences

Personal experiences with the UI of many websites for a large event, many focus on a sense of legibility of the navigation bar. The logo large and understandable on the top-left and the links of the other parts of the sites on the top-right, this pushes a compact navigation to the site. Many even have hover effects and the color scheme of the UI matches the whole theming of the site.

Many sites also display the main focus through a background image as a banner, with large, display text to hook in the viewers. Lower in the webpage, there has been many large blocks of text that informs about the events/products.

In the product page of many sites, they do usually display a large grid of available products from the platform. With each product's cell adjusting if the site is being displayed in a phone or PC screen. 

## Lo-Fi (Or Mid-Fi) Wireframes

Here is the wireframes for the website:
