# Project 3: Festival For A Cause: By Donovan Lee

## Overview

The basis of this project is to create a site for a fictional festival to support a cause. The chosen cause is to allow more lower-income students to have more opportunities for a higher education. A lot of higher education colleges are incredibly hard to enroll due to their enrollment prices and the acceptance rates of many classes. With this in mind, the festival is meant to provide events to provide entertainment and education through the activities. Doing so, this can help encourage people to support the cause and even bring more students to be supported by the cause.
